            <p >After working in finance sector as an insolvency administrator and a year studying Economics at University, I made the decision to switch to a career I’m passionate about and make the steps to become a software engineer by joining IN4 Groups Software Engineering bootcamp and enrolling on free Codecademy courses. I have always enjoyed problem solving and upon completion of my Software Engineering bootcamp in March, I feel I’d be ready for my first role in software development as I am starting to build confidence in the foundational skills I have learnt on the bootcamp by applying them to individual mini projects as well as working on a group project as part of the bootcamp.</p>
